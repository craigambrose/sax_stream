# Sax Stream

An XML parsing library using Nokogiri's Sax Parser which uses an object mapper to build objects from XML nodes and lets you use them as they are built, rather than waiting until the file is fully parsed.

The two main goals of this process are:

1. To avoid loading the entire XML file stream into memory at once.
2. To avoid loading all the mapped objects into memory simultaneously.

# Status

Currently development has only just started, please come back in a week.
